### Libraries/Modules needed for the project!
- Plotly, Seaborn - (To plot and visualize the data)
- Pandas - (To Clean and maipulate the data)
- Pymongo - (To store and retrieve the data by connecting with MongoDB Atlas)
- Streamlit - (To Create Graphical user Interface)

### Workflow :

#### Step 1 :
  Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset. 
#### Step 2 : 
  Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary. Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
#### Step 3 :
  Develop a streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps.
#### Step 4 :
  Use the cleaned data to analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. Create dynamic plots and charts that enable users to explore price trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.
#### Step 5 :
  Utilize Tableau or Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from your analysis. Combine different visualizations, such as maps, charts, and tables, to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.

# Conclusion:
- Created this project to visualize Airbnb data using Tableau.
- It mostly helps as customer to know about **Airbnb** price,locations,room,bed,prototype,country and host name,host id.. to easly interact with travel,tourism and other purposes.
- Customer can easly choose an affortable country to select affortable price and  their rating(review_scores) to visualize in the tableau and see informations.
- Through this exploratory data analysis and visualization project, we gained several interesting insights into the Airbnb rental market. Below we will summarize the answers to the questions that we wished to answer at the beginning of the project:

- How do prices of listings vary by location?/What localities in Countries are rated highly by guests? 

-*Portugal and Spain has the low rentals and high rating and all property type by varying prices to compared to the other countries.
 
-*Prices are higher for rentals closer to city hotspots. 

-*Rentals that are rated highly on the location by the host also have higher prices ex.US.

-*Apartment Type properties are having demand

-*Shared room type property is least prefered

-*China and Portugal having high availability with higher prices
